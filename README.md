Playing with QP/C++ and RFduino dev kit. 

This repo includes code from www.state-machine.com and www.rfduino.com and some changes I've made to their code in order to make them work together.

The directory inside RFduino_core (RFduino) should be added to your Arduino installation. 

Mac: 
Open the Arduino package contents and paste the directory in

Contents/Java/hardware/arduino/

It should reside next to the avr directory. 

PC: 
Dunno, put it close to the hardware/arduino/avr directory in your Arduino installation.
